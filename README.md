Packajoozle for GNU Octave
==========================

Packajoozle is a re-factoring of Octave's `pkg` tool to use OOP.

I'm just doing this as a fun exercise.
I don't intend on submitting this back up for inclusion in Octave.

## Installation and usage

* Clone the repo.
  * `git clone https://github.com/apjanke/octave-packajoozle`
* Add its `inst` dir to your Octave path
  * `cd /path/to/octave-packajoozle/inst`
  * `addpath (pwd)`

###

Use the `pkj` function like you would Octave's `pkg` function.
That's Packajoozle's version of it.
